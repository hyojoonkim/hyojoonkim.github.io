# Bio
Hi! I am an _Assistant Professor_ in the <b>[Department of Computer
Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science){:target="_blank"}</b> at the <b>[University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu){:target="_blank"}</b>.

Before joining UVA, I worked as a Research Scholar/Scientist at Princeton
University. I received my Ph.D. and M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech
and my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin - Madison. 

My [CV is here (PDF)](../files/HyojoonKim_CV.pdf){:target="_blank"}

# Research
My research focuses on making computer networks easier to monitor,
understand, troubleshoot, and configure. I enjoy designing fast and
accurate mechanisms that analyze real-world traffic and extract
useful information for network practitioners.  I am passionate about
designing and implementing better tools and systems for
next-generation applications and networks.  I often use tools and
mechanisms in software-defined networking (SDN), P4, and
programmable data planes. 
I am also enthusiastic about applying new ideas to real operational
networks.
           
<b><font color="red">Prospective Students:</font></b>
Iâ€™m looking for students interested in doing research in systems and
networking! If you want to learn, develop new ideas, design and implement them,
and impact our world, join us!\\
